# liverRegression

## About

This repo contains the code ran for the project "Challenges in Predicting Chromatin Accessibility Differences between Species".
This includes a program for quantile normalization (quantile_normalize.py) and extended quantile normalization (EQN.py).

Here, we document the workflow of how to train regression CNNs using the framework from https://github.com/pfenninglab/cnn_pipeline and how to create the cross-species evaluation sets.
